<h1>hi!</h1>
<p>i'm arjun, a rising junior @ berkeley majoring in EECS + EMS & minoring in Politics, Philosophy and Law</p>
<p>broadly my interests lie in eating gummy bears & going on walks. During both of these things, I often spend time thinking how to understand systems and creating models. I'm most expirenced with biological systems (DNA folding kinetics & thermodynamics, Protein folding, DNA oragami, NeRFs of the Brain) but I've worked to build models of hardware, spider webs, and environmental literacy</p>
