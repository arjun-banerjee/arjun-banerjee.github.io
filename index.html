<h1>hi!</h1>
<p>i'm arjun, a rising junior @ berkeley majoring in EECS + EMS & minoring in Politics, Philosophy and Law</p>
<p>i try to spend most of my day eating gummy bears and going on walks. in between this, you might find me trying to understand and model biological systems (namely: PLMs/GLM steering, DNA oragimi, DNA kinetics & thermodynamics, and the brain). 
<p>i'm also interested in hardware (mostly optimization algorithms in archetecture and analog), probability theory (high-dimensional modelling and baysian stats), LLMs in education, and spider webs.<p>
<p>outside of this you might find me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cory 521 (99% probability)
  <li>yelling @ 300wpm about geopolitics and losing national finals round(s) with PD@B</li>
  <li>teaching (either TAing 126/170 or volenteer tutoring for CSM)</li>
  <li>designing cloths and writing about music in GAG's fashion shows or magazines</li>
  <li>taking extremely overexposed film photos with Innod</li>
  <li>(unsucessfully) avoiding the 9-5 by making fun things with my friends @ web7 and darwin</li>
</ul>
